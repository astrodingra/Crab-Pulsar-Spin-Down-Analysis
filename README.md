<b>EXPLANATION</b> <br>
<b>Graph 1: Spin Period vs. Pulse Number</b><br>
Plot Description:<br>

X-axis: Pulse Number (index of each spin period in the sequence).<br>
Y-axis: Spin Period (time between consecutive pulses, in seconds).<br><br>
<b>Interpretation:</b><br>

<b>This plot shows how the spin period changes with each successive pulse.
If the pulsar is spinning down (i.e., its spin rate is decreasing), you might observe a trend where the spin periods gradually increase.
Any irregularities or significant deviations could indicate noise, observational errors, or interesting astrophysical phenomena such as glitches (sudden changes in spin period).</b>

<b style="color:blue">Since this is a single dataset we can't see a significant spin down rate. For effective results we need more data or we can simple predict future spin down rate on the basis of this data only and then we can match it by analysing year long dataset.</b>
<br><br>
<b>Graph 2: Spin Period vs. Time</b><br>
Plot Description:<br>

X-axis: Time (seconds since the start of the observation or another reference point).<br>
Y-axis: Spin Period (time between consecutive pulses, in seconds).<br><br>
<b>Interpretation:</b><br>

<b>This plot shows how the spin period changes over the actual observation time.
A clear increasing trend in the spin periods over time indicates that the pulsar is gradually slowing down.
This plot can also help identify long-term trends and any short-term variations in the pulsar's spin period.</b><br><br>
<i>Detailed Insights</i><br><br>
Spin-Down Rate:<br>

Graph 2 is particularly useful for calculating the spin-down rate, which is the rate at which the pulsar's rotation slows down over time. This can be done by fitting a linear or polynomial model to the data in this plot.<br><br>
Periodic Variations:

Both graphs can reveal periodic variations in the spin period, which might be related to intrinsic properties of the pulsar or external influences.<br><br>
Glitches:

Pulsars sometimes exhibit glitches, which are sudden increases in spin frequency (decreases in spin period). These would appear as sharp dips in the spin period in both plots.
